# 2048 Puzzle Game Project
  - [DEMO LINK](https://Oleksii-Mishchenko.github.io/2048_game/)

Welcome to my 2048 game project! This is a browser-based game that I developed using a combination of HTML, CSS (utilizing the SASS preprocessor), and JavaScript.

## Overview

The **2048 Game** is a classic puzzle game where the player's objective is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is initialized by opening [this link](https://Oleksii-Mishchenko.github.io/2048_game/) in a web browser and clicking the "Start" button. Arrow keys are used to move the tiles on the grid.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the game is built using HTML.
- **CSS/SASS:** Styling is implemented using CSS, with the styles being authored in the SASS preprocessor for maintainability and readability.
- **JavaScript:** The game logic is written in JavaScript, providing interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## Features

- **Score Display:** The overall score is prominently displayed in the top right corner.
- **Restart Option:** Players can restart the game at any time using the "Restart" button.
- **Game End Conditions:** The game concludes when the player achieves the number 2048 or there are no more possible moves.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with the game layout.
- `styles/main.scss`: Styles file, utilizing SASS for a more structured and modular approach.
- `scripts/main.js`: Core JavaScript file with the game's logic.

## How to Deploy

The project is easily deployable by opening [this link](https://Oleksii-Mishchenko.github.io/2048_game/) in any modern web browser.
